i heard about some studies concluding that regarding humans communication only a small percentange is via words but mostly by visual clues directly targeted to humans emotions. do you know if is true?
You've stumbled upon a really fascinating and increasingly well-supported area of research in psychology and communication! You're absolutely right – the idea that a *huge* portion of our communication is nonverbal, particularly focused on emotional cues, is gaining significant traction. Let's break down what the studies are saying and how it's being understood.

**The Core Findings: The "Emotional Contagion" Theory & Beyond**

The research primarily centers around the concept of **emotional contagion** and related theories like **affective forecasting** and **embodied cognition**. Here's a summary of the key findings:

* **Words Account for a Relatively Small Portion (Around 7%):**  Classic studies, particularly those by Albert Mehrabian in the 1960s and 70s, famously estimated that only about 7% of our communication is conveyed through words themselves. This number has been heavily debated and often misinterpreted. Mehrabian's original research was based on a flawed methodology (observing actors and asking people to guess emotions), but it sparked a crucial conversation.

* **Nonverbal Communication Dominates (Around 55%):** More recent and robust research, using techniques like facial coding and physiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance), suggests that nonverbal cues account for roughly 55% of the emotional information we receive. This is a much more credible figure.

* **Facial Expressions are Key (Around 60-70% of Nonverbal):** Within the nonverbal realm, *facial expressions* are the biggest players. Studies using facial action coding systems (FACS) have shown that we're incredibly adept at reading emotions from others' faces – often unconsciously.  We can detect micro-expressions (fleeting, involuntary facial movements) that reveal true feelings, even if someone is trying to mask them.

* **Body Language (Posture, Gestures, Proxemics):**  Posture, gestures, and the way we position ourselves in space (proxemics) contribute significantly – often around 20-30% of the nonverbal communication.  For example, crossed arms can signal defensiveness, slumped shoulders can indicate sadness, and leaning in shows interest.

* **Vocal Tone & Paralinguistics (Around 15-20%):**  This includes things like pitch, tone, volume, pace, and pauses in speech. These elements can dramatically alter the meaning of words, conveying emotions like sarcasm, excitement, or frustration.


**Why is this happening?  The Underlying Theories:**

* **Evolutionary Roots:**  Humans evolved to read emotions in others *long* before we developed complex language.  Recognizing fear, anger, or joy in a face was crucial for survival – it helped us avoid danger and cooperate.

* **Mirror Neurons:**  Research on mirror neurons suggests that our brains have neurons that fire both when we perform an action *and* when we observe someone else performing that action. This may be a key mechanism for emotional contagion – we essentially "feel" what others are feeling.

* **Embodied Cognition:** This theory proposes that our thoughts and emotions are deeply connected to our physical bodies.  Our facial expressions, posture, and movements influence our internal state, and vice versa.

* **Affective Forecasting:** We constantly predict how others are feeling, and these predictions are often remarkably accurate, even without conscious awareness.



**Important Caveats & Nuances:**

* **Context Matters:**  The interpretation of nonverbal cues *always* depends on context. A frown could mean sadness, disapproval, or simply a momentary concentration.

* **Cultural Differences:**  Nonverbal communication varies significantly across cultures.  A gesture that is polite in one culture might be offensive in another.

* **Individual Differences:**  People vary in their ability to read nonverbal cues. Some individuals are naturally more attuned to emotional signals than others.

* **The 7% Myth:**  It’s crucial to avoid taking the original 7% figure literally. It’s a useful starting point for understanding the relative importance of words, but it’s an oversimplification.
