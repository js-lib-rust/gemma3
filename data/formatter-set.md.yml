        content: |
          Your pulse pressure is currently measured at 47 mmHg. While within a range, it is a little elevated. Pulse pressure is the difference between your systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and a value of 47 mmHg suggests a slightly higher than ideal arterial stiffness.

          Your body temperature of 38.2 °C is slightly elevated. A normal body temperature typically ranges from 36.5 °C to 37.5 °C. While not drastically high, it suggests you might have a mild fever. I recommend monitoring it and considering rest and hydration. If it persists or worsens, consulting a medical professional would be prudent.
