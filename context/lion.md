Lions are carnivores and they hunt mostly antelopes, zebras and wildebeests. Although lions are larger and stronger, lionesses are in charge for the hunt.
Lions act like scavengers and often attack hyenas and steal their prey.
During one meal, lions can eat up to 40 pounds of meat. After they fill their bellies, lions will snooze more than 20 hours.
Lion back teeth are called carnassals and they work like a pair of scissors. Chopped meat will be swallowed without chewing.
Lions are easily recognized by their manes. Larger and darker mane suggests that lion is very strong and other lions often avoid him. Lionesses react differently - they are attracted by the large and dark manes.
When lion and lioness meet, they greet each other by rubbing. During this process, they exchange scents.
Lioness will give birth to 1-3 cubs each 2 years. Cubs have spots at birth, but they disappear in time.
When lion and tiger mate, new type of animal named liger is created. Liger has stripes like tiger, but the color of its fur is pale compared to tiger's fur.
Lions have retractable claws, which mean that they could "hide" their claws during the play and avoid hurting each other.
Long tail provides balance when lions are running, but it can be also used to signalize various commands to other members of the pride: "come", "I am flirting with you", "go this way"…
Porcupine is one of the worst enemies of lions. Their sharp quills can be stuck in the lion's jaw for the rest of his life.
Until they reach 2 years, lions can't roar. Once they learn how to vocalize, their roars can be heard on the distance of up to 5 miles.
When young males reach maturity, older males will kick them out of the pride. When they wander on their own, young lions are known as nomads. If they manage to survive and gain strength, they will battle with other lions to take over a pride for themselves.
When new lion take over a pride, it kills all cubs that are not his own. In the wild, ¾ of cubs die at young age.
Lions live up to 15 years in the wild, while they can survive 25-30 years in captivity. Number of lions decreased drastically in the past couple of decades. They are one of the well known endangered animal species.

The lion (Panthera leo) is a very large mammal that belongs to the Felidae (cat) family. Some big male lions can weigh more than 250 kilograms (about 550 pounds). Today, wild lions live in parts of Africa (south of the Sahara desert) and in Asia. Lions are good at living in grasslands and areas with a mix of trees and grass. Female lions, called lionesses, are smaller and very fast over short distances. They work together to hunt herd animals.

Long ago, lions lived on almost every continent. But over time, they disappeared from North Africa and southwest Asia. About 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most common large land mammal after humans.

Sadly, the lion is now a vulnerable species. This means their numbers are dropping. In Africa, their population went down by 30–50% in just 20 years during the late 1900s. Losing their habitat (their natural home) and conflicts with humans are the biggest problems. There are only about a quarter as many lions in Africa today as there were 40 years ago.

Lions are often called the "king of the beasts." They are used as symbols of courage. You can see them in heraldry (symbols on shields or flags) more than any other animal. They represent bravery and royalty.

In the wild, lions usually live for 10 to 14 years. If they live in zoos, they can live longer than 20 years. Male lions in the wild often don't live past 10 years because of injuries from fighting with other males.

Even though they are sometimes called the "King of the Jungle," lions don't actually live in jungles. They usually live in savannas and grasslands. These areas have some bushes and trees, but lions are mostly adapted to hunt their prey in open grasslands.

“A lion sleeps in the heart of every brave man.” – Turkish Proverb

The 10th of August marks World Lion Day, an important day for the awareness of conservation efforts. Although this creature is a well-known safari icon, we thought we’d share a few educational facts about one of the wild’s most popular animals.

Their power starts with their builds

A male lion can weigh up to 190kg, whilst females can weigh as much as 126kg. This has a large impact on their abilities to hunt large prey and defend their territories, which is why they’re able to take down buffalo and the like.

There’s a story behind every mane

A male lion’s trademark mane is easily one of the species’ most identifiable characteristics. Not only is it useful for telling males from females, but it’s also a clear sign of dominance. The older the lion, the darker and more impressive the mane. Growing to lengths of up to 16cm, these manes help attract a mate, whilst also protecting their necks and heads from injuries during hunting and fighting.

They use the elements to their advantage

The intelligence of lions is rather impressive. Not only do they hunt mostly at night with eyes that perform under the cover of darkness, but they also choose to hunt during storms. Using the noises of wind and rain to conceal their movements, they’re able to catch their prey unaware.

They’re big on togetherness

Not only are cubs reared together but lions hunt together and are the only big cats who roar together. Even cubs join the calling that can last around 40 seconds. The call of a pride of lions is a magnificent sound that can be heard up to 8km away.
Their numbers are dwindling…

Whilst the number of lions in the wild may not have reached “rhino” status as yet, there are only an estimated 23 000 left. This statistic is even more concerning when you consider that the number of African elephants in the wild currently sits at 415 000. Threats to the wild lion population include climate change, farming, scarcity of prey and the illegal wildlife trade.
