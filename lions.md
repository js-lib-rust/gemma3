Historical lion distribution  
  
The **lion** (_**Panthera leo**_) is a large cat of the genus _Panthera_ ,
currently ranging only in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular,
broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft
at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger
than females and have a more prominent mane that usually obscures the ears and
extends to the shoulders.

The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is an apex and
keystone predator, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. It is
usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to
being active at night and at twilight. It is a social species, forming groups
called prides. A lion pride consists of related females and cubs, and a few or
one adult male who is unrelated to the females. Groups of female lions usually
hunt together. Adult males often compete to keep or gain that membership in
the pride.

During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia,
from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented
populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has
been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations
in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion
populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the
cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with
humans are the greatest causes for concern.

The lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on
national flags, and in literature and films. It is one of the most widely
recognised animal symbols in human culture. Lions have been kept in menageries
since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for
exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century.
Cultural depictions of lions have occurred worldwide, particularly as a symbol
of power and royalty. They figure prominently as symbols and deities in
ancient religions.

## Etymology

The English word _lion_ is derived via Anglo-Norman _liun_ from Latin _leōnem_
(nominative: _leō_), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek λέων
_léōn_. The Hebrew word לָבִיא _lavi_ may also be related.[4] The generic name
_Panthera_ is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient
Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[5]

Phylogeny of the genus _Panthera_ based on a 2016 nuclear DNA study[6]  
  
_Felis leo_ was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who
described the lion in his work _Systema Naturae_.[3] The genus name _Panthera_
was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816.[7] Between the mid-18th and mid-20th
centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of
which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005.[2] They were distinguished mostly
by the size and colour of their manes and skins.[8]

### Subspecies

In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and
proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until
2017.[2] Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two
subspecific names: _P. l. leo_ for African lion populations, and _P. l.
persica_ for the Asiatic lion population.[1][9][10] In 2017, the Cat
Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy,
and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic
studies on lion evolution, namely:[11]

  * _P. l. leo_ (Linnaeus, 1758) − the nominate lion subspecies includes the Asiatic lion, the regionally extinct Barbary lion, and lion populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa.[11] Synonyms include _P. l. persica_ (Meyer, 1826), _P. l. senegalensis_ (Meyer, 1826), _P. l. kamptzi_ (Matschie, 1900), and _P. l. azandica_ (Allen, 1924).[2] It has been called 'northern lion' and 'northern subspecies'.[12][13]
  * _P. l. melanochaita_ (Smith, 1842) − includes the extinct Cape lion and lion populations in East and Southern African regions.[11] Synonyms include _P. l. somaliensis_ (Noack 1891), _P. l. massaica_ (Neumann, 1900), _P. l. sabakiensis_ (Lönnberg, 1910), _P. l. bleyenberghi_ (Lönnberg, 1914), _P. l. roosevelti_ (Heller, 1914), _P. l. nyanzae_ (Heller, 1914), _P. l. hollisteri_ (Allen, 1924), _P. l. krugeri_ (Roberts, 1929), _P. l. vernayi_ (Roberts, 1948), and _P. l. webbiensis_ (Zukowsky, 1964).[2][8] It has been referred to as 'southern subspecies' and 'southern lion'.[13]

However, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups in
northern Central Africa. DNA analysis from a more recent study indicates that
Central African lions are derived from both northern and southern lions, as
they cluster with _P. leo leo_ in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas their
genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. _leo melanochaita_.[14]

Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically
with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia
cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers, therefore, assume Ethiopia
is a contact zone between the two subspecies.[15] Genome-wide data of a wild-
born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with _P. l.
leo_ in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to _P. l.
melanochaita_ ; this suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central
Africa may require revision.[16]

### Fossil records

Other lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in
prehistoric times:[17]

  * _P. fossilis_ was larger than the modern lion and lived in the Middle Pleistocene. Bone fragments were excavated in caves in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Czech Republic.[18][19]
  * _P. spelaea_ , or the **cave lion** , lived in Eurasia and Beringia during the Late Pleistocene. It became extinct due to climate warming or human expansion latest by 11,900 years ago.[20] Bone fragments excavated in European, North Asian, Canadian and Alaskan caves indicate that it ranged from Europe across Siberia into western Alaska.[21] It likely derived from _P. fossilis_ ,[22] and was genetically isolated and highly distinct from the modern lion in Africa and Eurasia.[23][22] It is depicted in Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts.[24]
  * _P. atrox_, or the **American lion** , ranged in the Americas from Canada to possibly Patagonia during the Late Pleistocene.[25] It diverged from the cave lion around 165,000 years ago.[26]

Additionally, in 1938 paleontologist Paulus Deraniyagala named a subspecies
_P. l. sinhaleyus_ based on two fossils, a lower left carnassial and a damaged
right lower canine tooth, both excavated from deposits in Kuruwita, Sri Lanka.
He called it "narrower and more elongate" but otherwise failed to distinguish
_P. l. sinhaleyus_ from other lion subspecies. A subsequent study of felid
fossils from the Kuruwita deposits in 2005 described the fossils in further
detail but only assigned to them to _P. leo_.[27][28]

Maximal range of the modern lion  
and its prehistoric relatives  
in the late Pleistocene

The _Panthera_ lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the
common ancestor of the Felidae around 10.8 million years ago.[29]
Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard ancestors possibly continued until
about 2.1 million years ago.[6] The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the
Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene.[30] The
earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania
and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old.[31]

Estimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range
from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on mutation rate per generation time
of the modern lion. There is no evidence for gene flow between the two
lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area.[16] The
Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial
period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents.[23][32][33] The
modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle
Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late
Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became separated
from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial rainforest
expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago.[34] They shared a common ancestor
probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago.[16] Due to the expansion of the
Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North
Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to
more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North
Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years
ago.[34]

Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East
interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic
evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and Southern
Africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than
genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central
Africa.[35] A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples
from West Africa shared alleles with samples from Southern Africa, and samples
from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia. This phenomenon
indicates that Central Africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they
had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the Nile Basin
during the early Holocene.[16]

### Hybrids

Further information: Panthera hybrid

In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity
of visitors or for scientific purpose.[36][37] The liger is bigger than a lion
and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their
parents because of reciprocal gene effects.[38][39] The leopon is a hybrid
between a lion and leopard.[40]

Skeleton

The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a
reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in
colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The
colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark
spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still
be seen on the legs and underparts.[41][42] The tail of all lions ends in a
dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20
in)-long, hard "spine" or "spur" composed of dermal papillae.[43] The
functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth, develops at
around 5+1⁄2 months of age and is readily identifiable at the age of seven
months.[44]

Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is
usually more depressed and flattened and has a slightly shorter postorbital
region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount
of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower
jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.[45][46]

The skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and
represent the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.[47][48] Despite
this, their thigh muscles do not exceed and only approach the mass predicted
for their body mass.[49] The lion has a high concentration of fast twitch
muscle fibres, giving them quick bursts of speed but less stamina.[50][51]

### Size

Among felids, the lion is second only to the tiger in size.[42] The size and
weight of adult lions vary across its range and habitats.[52][53][54][55]
Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa
and India.[41][56][57][58]

Average| Female lions| Male lions  
---|---|---  
Head-and-body length | 160–184 cm (63–72 in)[59] | 184–208 cm (72–82 in)[59]  
Tail length | 72–89.5 cm (28.3–35.2 in)[59] | 82.5–93.5 cm (32.5–36.8 in)[59]  
Weight | 118.37–143.52 kg (261.0–316.4 lb) in Southern Africa,[52]  
119.5 kg (263 lb) in East Africa,[52]  
110–120 kg (240–260 lb) in India[53] | 186.55–225 kg (411.3–496.0 lb) in Southern Africa,[52]

The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species.[8] It
may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago.[60] It grows downwards and
backwards, covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is
typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust, and black hairs.[42]
Mutations in the genes microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and
tyrosinase are possibly responsible for the colour of manes.[61][62] It starts
growing when lions enter adolescence, when testosterone levels increase, and
reach their full size at around four years old.[63] Cool ambient temperatures
in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane.[64] On
average, Asiatic lions have sparser manes than African lions.[65][_page
needed_]

This feature likely evolved to signal the fitness of males to females. Males
with darker manes appear to have greater reproductive success and are more
likely to remain in a pride for longer. They have longer and thicker hair and
higher testosterone levels, but they are also more vulnerable to heat
stress.[66][67] The core body temperature does apparently not increase
regardless of sex, season, feeding time, length and colour of mane, but only
surface temperature is affected.[68] Unlike in other felid species, female
lions consistently interact with multiple males at once.[69] Another
hypothesis suggests that the mane also serves to protect the neck in fights,
but this is disputed.[70][71] During fights, including those involving
maneless females and adolescents, the neck is not targeted as much as the
face, back, and hindquarters. Injured lions also begin to lose their
manes.[72]

Almost all male lions in Pendjari National Park are either maneless or have
very short manes.[73] Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in
Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya.[74]
Castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads
inhibits testosterone production.[75] Rarely, both wild and captive lionesses
have manes.[76][77] Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses
reported in northern Botswana.[78]

### Colour variation

Further information: White lion

The white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism, which
is caused by a double recessive allele. It is not albino; it has normal
pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lions have occasionally been
encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati
Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild
in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion gene pool. Nevertheless, 17
births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015.[79] White
lions are selected for breeding in captivity.[80] They have reportedly been
bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned
hunts.[81]

## Distribution and habitat

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Lions.Gir5.jpg/250px-
Lions.Gir5.jpg)Lion in Gir National Park, India

African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The
lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers, and open
woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests. On Mount Elgon, the
lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to
the snow line on Mount Kenya.[41] Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to
1,500 mm (12 to 59 in) make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa,
estimated at 3,390,821 km2 (1,309,203 sq mi) at most, but remnant populations
are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and montane forests
in East Africa.[82] The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around Gir
National Park in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry
savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.[9]

### Historical range

In Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central
African rainforest zone and the Sahara desert.[83] In the 1960s, it became
extinct in North Africa, except in the southern part of Sudan.[84][82][85]

During the mid-Holocene, around 8,000-6,000 years ago, the range of lions
expanded into Southeastern and Eastern Europe, partially re-occupying the
range of the now extinct cave lion.[86] In Hungary, the modern lion was
present from about 4,500 to 3,200 years Before Present.[87] In Ukraine, the
modern lion was present from about 6,400 to 2,000 years Before Present.[86] In
Greece, it was common, as reported by Herodotus in 480 BC; it was considered
rare by 300 BC and extirpated by AD 100.[41]

In Asia the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an
abundance of prey.[88] It was present in the Caucasus until the 10th
century.[46] It lived in the Levant until the Middle Ages and in Southwest
Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been
extirpated in most of Turkey.[89] The last live lion in Iran was sighted in
1942, about 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Dezful,[90] although the corpse of a
lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river in Khuzestan province in
1944.[91] It once ranged from Sind and Punjab in Pakistan to Bengal and the
Narmada River in central India.[92]

## Behaviour and ecology

Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty
hours per day.[93] Although lions can be active at any time, their activity
generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and
defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting
most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and
fifty minutes eating.[94]

The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of
related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a "pride".
Groups of male lions are called "coalitions".[95] Females form the stable
social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females.[96] The majority
of females remain in their birth prides while all males and some females
disperse.[97] The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several
adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides
of up to 30 individuals have been observed.[98] The sole exception to this
pattern is the Tsavo lion pride that always had only one adult male.[99]
Prides act as fission–fusion societies, and members split into subgroups that
keep in contact with roars.[100]

Nomadic lions range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or
alone.[95] Pairs are more frequent among related males. A lion may switch
lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa.[101] Interactions
between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrus
allow nomadic males to approach them.[102] Males spend years in a nomadic
phase before gaining residence in a pride.[103] A study undertaken in the
Serengeti National Park revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at
between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age.[104] In Kruger National Park, dispersing
male lions move more than 25 km (16 mi) away from their natal pride in search
of their own territory. Female lions stay closer to their natal pride.
Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than
male lions in the same area.[105]

The evolution of sociability in lions was likely driven both by high
population density and the clumped resources of savannah habitats. The larger
the pride, the more high-quality territory they can defend; "hotspots" are
near river confluences, where they have optimal access to water, prey and
vegetation cover.[106][107] A study on three lion prides in a Zimbabwean
wildlife reserve revealed that the dominant pride of 12 lions had the shortest
average distance to water and the smallest home range of 130.35 km2 (50.33 sq
mi); the smallest pride of four lions had the longest average distance to
water and the largest home range of 174.6 km2 (67.4 sq mi).[108]

The area occupied by a pride is called a "pride area" whereas that occupied by
a nomad is a "range".[95] Males associated with a pride patrol the
fringes.[42] Both males and females defend the pride against intruders, but
the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more
powerful build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against
intruders, while others lag behind.[109] Lions tend to assume specific roles
in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable services to
the group.[110] Alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a
leader that fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is
reflected in these responses.[111] The male or males associated with the pride
must defend their relationship with the pride from outside males who may
attempt to usurp them.[101]

Asiatic lion prides differ in group composition. Male Asiatic lions are
solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride while
females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a stronger pride
together with their cubs. Female and male lions associate only when
mating.[112] Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single
lions. Males in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced
hierarchy, in which one male dominates the others and mates more
frequently.[113]

Lions feeding on a zebra

The lion is a generalist hypercarnivore and is considered to be both an apex
and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum.[114][115] Its prey
consists mainly of medium-sized to large ungulates, particularly blue
wildebeest, plains zebra, African buffalo, gemsbok and giraffe. It also
frequently takes common warthog despite it being much smaller.[116] In India,
chital and sambar deer are the most common wild prey,[42][116][117] while
livestock contributes significantly to lion kills outside protected
areas.[118] It usually avoids adult elephants, rhinoceros and hippopotamus and
small prey like dik-dik, hyraxes, hares and monkeys, and seldom consumes other
predators; unusual prey include small reptiles and porcupines.[119]

Young lions first display stalking behaviour at around three months of age,
although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old
and begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.[120] Single lions
are capable of bringing down zebra and wildebeest, while larger prey like
buffalo and giraffe are riskier.[101] In Chobe National Park, large prides
have been observed hunting African bush elephants up to around 15 years old in
exceptional cases, with the victims being calves, juveniles, and even
subadults.[121][122] In typical group hunts, each lioness has a favoured
position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing", then attacking, or
moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey
fleeing from other lionesses. Males attached to prides do not usually
participate in group hunting.[123] Some evidence suggests, however, that males
are just as successful as females; they are typically solo hunters who ambush
prey in small bushland.[124] They join in the hunting of large, slower-moving
prey like buffalo; and even hunt them on their own. Moderately-sized hunting
groups generally have higher success rates than lone females and larger
groups.[125] Lions studied in Queen Elizabeth National Park increased their
chances of success when hunting at night and moonless nights, when the prey
was solitary and the cover of bushes dense; the chances of success increased
when they attacked from a distance of 20 m (66 ft) and with a grass cover of
80 cm (31 in) tall.[126]

Lions are not particularly known for their stamina. For instance, a lioness's
heart comprises only 0.57% of her body weight and a male's is about 0.45% of
his body weight, whereas a hyena's heart comprises almost 1% of its body
weight.[127] Thus, lions run quickly only in short bursts at about 48–59 km/h
(30–37 mph) and need to be close to their prey before starting the
attack.[128] They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills
take place near some form of cover or at night.[129] One study in 2018
recorded a lion running at a top speed of 74.1 km/h (46.0 mph).[130] Analysis
of films of lion hunting has found that lions have an initial acceleration of
9.5 m/s², while a Thomson's gazelle has an acceleration of only 4.5 m/s², even
though lions only reached 50 km/h (31 mph) compared to the gazelles' nearly 97
km/h (60 mph); lions stalk their prey in order to attack them unexpectedly, as
their prey begins to run unprepared while the predator is better prepared to
run.[49] The lion's attack is short and powerful; it attempts to catch prey
with a fast rush and final leap, usually pulls it down by the rump, and kills
with a clamping bite to the throat or muzzle. It can hold the prey's throat
for up to 13 minutes, until the prey stops moving.[131] It has a bite force
from 1593.8 to 1768 Newtons at the canine tip and up to 4167.6 Newtons at the
carnassial notch.[132][133][134]

Lions typically consume prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes drag
large prey into cover.[135] They tend to squabble over kills, particularly the
males. Cubs suffer most when food is scarce but otherwise all pride members
eat their fill, including old and crippled lions, which can live on
leftovers.[101] Large kills are shared more widely among pride members.[136]
An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg (11 lb) of meat per day
while males require about 7 kg (15 lb).[137] Lions gorge themselves and eat up
to 30 kg (66 lb) in one session.[91] If it is unable to consume all of the
kill, it rests for a few hours before continuing to eat. On hot days, the
pride retreats to shade with one or two males standing guard.[135] Lions
defend their kills from scavengers such as vultures and hyenas.[101]

Lions scavenge on carrion when the opportunity arises, scavenging animals dead
from natural causes such as disease or those that were killed by other
predators. Scavenging lions keep a constant lookout for circling vultures,
which indicate the death or distress of an animal.[138] Most carrion on which
both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by hyenas rather than lions.[55]
Carrion is thought to provide a large part of lion diet.[139]

Lioness stealing a kill from a leopard in Kruger National Park

Lions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and compete for
prey and carrion; a review of data across several studies indicates a dietary
overlap of 58.6%.[140] Lions typically ignore hyenas unless they are on a kill
or are being harassed, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence
of lions with or without the presence of food. In the Ngorongoro crater, lions
subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing them to increase their
kill rate.[141] In Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed
as hyenas there frequently challenge lions and steal their kills, obtaining
food from 63% of all lion kills.[142] When confronted on a kill, hyenas may
either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 m (98–328 ft) until the
lions have finished.[143] Hyenas may feed alongside lions and force them off a
kill. The two species attack one another even when there is no food involved
for no apparent reason.[144] Lions can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths
in Etosha National Park. Hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that
enter their home ranges.[145] When the lion population in Kenya's Masai Mara
National Reserve declined, the spotted hyena population increased
rapidly.[146]

Lions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, steal their kills and kill their
cubs and even adults when given the chance.[147] Cheetahs often lose their
kills to lions or other predators.[148] A study in the Serengeti ecosystem
revealed that lions killed at least 17 of 125 cheetah cubs born between 1987
and 1990.[149] Cheetahs avoid their competitors by hunting at different times
and habitats.[150] Leopards, by contrast, do not appear to be motivated by an
avoidance of lions, as they use heavy vegetation regardless of whether lions
are present in an area and both cats are active around the same time of day.
In addition, there is no evidence that lions affect leopard abundance.[151]
Leopards take refuge in trees, though lionesses occasionally attempt to climb
up and retrieve their kills.[152]

Lions similarly dominate African wild dogs, taking their kills and dispatching
pups or adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where
lions are more abundant.[153] However, there are a few reported cases of old
and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs.[154][155]

### Reproduction and life cycle

Most lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age.[156] Lions do
not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous.[157] Like
those of other cats, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward.
During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's
vagina, which may cause ovulation.[158][159] A lioness may mate with more than
one male when she is in heat.[160] Lions of both sexes may be involved in
group homosexual and courtship activities. Males also head-rub and roll around
with each other before mounting each other.[161][162] Generation length of the
lion is about seven years.[163] The average gestation period is around 110
days;[157] the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in
a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other
sheltered area, usually away from the pride. She will often hunt alone while
the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den.[164] Lion
cubs are born blind, their eyes opening around seven days after birth. They
weigh 1.2–2.1 kg (2.6–4.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to
crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.[165] To
avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness
moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-
one by the nape of the neck.[164]

Lionesses of reproductive age within a pride have a similar number of
surviving cubs, which they initially keep hidden. Lionesses without offspring
do not assist in the care of the communal litter.[166] Usually, the mother
does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are
six to eight weeks old.[164] Sometimes the introduction to pride life occurs
earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same
time.[101][167] When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack
confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They soon
begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among
themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults.[167] Lionesses with
cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs
than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies—one male could
patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, while another may snarl
and bat the cubs away.[168]

Pride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and communal
rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle indiscriminately from any or
all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronisation of births is
advantageous because the cubs grow to being roughly the same size and have an
equal chance of survival, and sucklings are not dominated by older
cubs.[101][167] Weaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach
maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of
challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They
begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.[169]

When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride,
the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not
become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often
fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful
unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the
male.[170] Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by
leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal
pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age,[171] while
some females may leave when they reach the age of two.[97] When a new male
lion takes over a pride, adolescents both male and female may be evicted.[172]

### Health and mortality

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Lake-Nakuru-Lions-in-
Tree.JPG/250px-Lake-Nakuru-Lions-in-Tree.JPG)Lions in a tree near Lake Nakuru

Lions may live 12–17 years in the wild.[42] Although adult lions have no
natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans
or other lions.[173] Lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other
prides they encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride
when fighting at a kill.[174] Crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to
hyenas and leopards or be trampled by buffalo or elephants. Careless lions may
be maimed when hunting prey.[175] Nile crocodiles also kill and eat lions,
evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.[176]

Ticks commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of the lions.[177][178]
Adult forms of several tapeworm species of the genus _Taenia_ have been
isolated from lion intestines, having been ingested as larvae in antelope
meat.[179] Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of
stable fly (_Stomoxys calcitrans_) in 1962, resulting in lions becoming
emaciated and covered in bloody, bare patches. Lions sought unsuccessfully to
evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many
died or migrated and the local population dropped from 70 to 15
individuals.[180] A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions.[181]

Captive lions have been infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) since at
least the mid-1970s.[182] CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores;
a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing
neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions
died from pneumonia and encephalitis.[183] Feline immunodeficiency virus and
lentivirus also affect captive lions.[184][185]

### Communication

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Lion_cub_with_mother.jpg/250px-
Lion_cub_with_mother.jpg)

Head rubbing among pride members is a common social behaviour.

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Lion_%28Panthera_leo%29_marking_its_territory_..._%2852806595064%29.jpg/250px-
Lion_%28Panthera_leo%29_marking_its_territory_..._%2852806595064%29.jpg)

A male lion raises his tail while marking his territory.

When resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of behaviours; the
animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful,
tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,[186] which have been
compared with the role of allogrooming among primates.[187] Head rubbing,
nuzzling the forehead, face and neck against another lion appears to be a form
of greeting[188] and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others
or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs
and females rub females.[189] Social licking often occurs in tandem with head
rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure.
The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour
may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas
themselves.[190]

Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as
visual gestures.[191] A common facial expression is the "grimace face" or
flehmen response, which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and
involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose, closed
eyes and relaxed ears.[192] Lions also use chemical and visual marking;[191]
males spray urine[193][194] and scrape plots of ground and objects within the
territory.[191]

The lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in intensity and
pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion vocalisations are
variations of roaring, growling and snarling. Other sounds produced include
puffing, humming, and exhalations similar to purring, while cubs communicate
by meowing and bleating. Roaring is used to advertise the animal's presence.
Lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 8
km (5.0 mi).[195] They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting
with a few deep, long roars that subside into grunts.[196][197]

## Conservation

The lion is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Indian population
is listed on CITES Appendix I and the African population on CITES Appendix
II.[1]

### In Africa

Video of a wild lioness

Several large and well-managed protected areas in Africa host large lion
populations. Where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been developed,
cash revenue for park management and local communities is a strong incentive
for lion conservation.[1] Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa;
their numbers are rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% in the
late half of the 20th century. Primary causes of the decline include disease
and human interference.[1] In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s,
lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer.[198] Estimates of the
African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in
2002–2004.[199][84]

In the Republic of the Congo, Odzala-Kokoua National Park was considered a
lion stronghold in the 1990s. By 2014, no lions were recorded in the protected
area so the population is considered locally extinct.[200] The West African
lion population is isolated from the one in Central Africa, with little or no
exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it was estimated that this
population consists of about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature
individuals. They persist in three protected areas in the region, mostly in
one population in the W A P protected area complex, shared by Benin, Burkina
Faso and Niger. This population is listed as Critically Endangered.[10] Field
surveys in the WAP ecosystem revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W
National Park, and higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better
protection.[201]

A population occurs in Cameroon's Waza National Park, where between
approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009.[202] In addition, 50 to
150 lions are estimated to be present in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou
ecosystem.[203] In 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in
Ghana's Mole National Park. These were the first sightings of lions in the
country in 39 years.[204] In the same year, a population of up to 200 lions
that was previously thought to have been extirpated was filmed in the Alatash
National Park, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border.[205][206]

In 2005, Lion Conservation Strategies were developed for West and Central
Africa, and East and Southern Africa. The strategies seek to maintain suitable
habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for lions, reduce factors that
lead to further fragmentation of populations, and make lion–human coexistence
sustainable.[207][208] Lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced
in areas where herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. Such measures
contribute to mitigating human–lion conflict.[209]

### In Asia

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Lion_Gir.jpg/250px-
Lion_Gir.jpg)A lioness in Gir National Park

The last refuge of the Asiatic lion population is the 1,412 km2 (545 sq mi)
Gir National Park and surrounding areas in the region of Saurashtra or
Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat State, India. The population has risen from
approximately 180 lions in 1974 to about 400 in 2010.[210] It is
geographically isolated, which can lead to inbreeding and reduced genetic
diversity. Since 2008, the Asiatic lion has been listed as Endangered on the
IUCN Red List.[9] By 2015, the population had grown to 523 individuals
inhabiting an area of 7,000 km2 (2,700 sq mi) in Saurashtra.[211][212][213] In
2017, about 650 individuals were recorded during the Asiatic Lion Census.[214]

The presence of numerous human settlements close to Gir National Park resulted
in conflict between lions, local people and their livestock.[215][211] Some
consider the presence of lions a benefit, as they keep populations of crop
damaging herbivores in check.[216]

### Captive breeding

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/India_Animals.jpg/250px-
India_Animals.jpg)Captive male Asiatic lions in Sanjay Gandhi National Park,
India

Lions imported to Europe before the middle of the 19th century were possibly
foremost Barbary lions from North Africa, or Cape lions from Southern
Africa.[217] Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in Addis
Ababa Zoo are descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink
International in collaboration with Oxford University launched an ambitious
International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding
Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in
the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.[218] However, a genetic analysis showed that
the captive lions at Addis Ababa Zoo were not Barbary lions, but rather
closely related to wild lions in Chad and Cameroon.[219]

In 1982, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums started a Species Survival Plan
for the Asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. In 1987, it was
found that most lions in North American zoos were hybrids between African and
Asiatic lions.[220] Breeding programs need to note origins of the
participating animals to avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus
reducing their conservation value.[221] Captive breeding of lions was halted
to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and pedigree. Wild-born lions were
imported to American zoos from Africa between 1989 and 1995. Breeding was
continued in 1998 in the frame of an African lion Species Survival Plan.[222]

About 77% of the captive lions registered in the International Species
Information System in 2006 were of unknown origin; these animals might have
carried genes that are extinct in the wild and may therefore be important to
the maintenance of the overall genetic variability of the lion.[64]

## Interactions with humans

### In zoos and circuses

19th-century etching of a lion tamer in a cage with lions and tigers

Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo
exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are more
selective about their exhibits,[223] there are more than 1,000 African and 100
Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered
an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation
purposes.[224] Lions can live over twenty years in captivity; for example,
three sibling lions at the Honolulu Zoo lived to the age of 22 in
2007.[225][226]

The first European "zoos" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th
century, and until the 17th century were called seraglios. At that time, they
came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They
spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of
Europe.[227] In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed,
lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John
in the 13th century;[228][229] this was probably stocked with animals from an
earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his hunting lodge in
Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where according to William of Malmesbury lions had
been stocked.[230]

Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger
lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.[231] Further changes
took place in the early 20th century when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures
with concrete "rocks", more open space and a moat instead of bars, more
closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck designed lion enclosures for
both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo; although his designs were
popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the
1960s.[232] In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the
use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors
to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the Cat
Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park placed the den on ground
level, higher than visitors.[233]

Lion taming has been part of both established circuses and individual acts
such as Siegfried & Roy. The practice began in the early 19th century by
Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh, who both toured widely
and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.[234] Martin
composed a pantomime titled _Les Lions de Mysore_ ("the lions of Mysore"), an
idea Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the
central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early
20th century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over
animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous
centuries.[234] The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a
lion is demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth.
The now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde
Beatty (1903–1965).[235]

Lion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal tradition,
intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. Such hunts took
place in a reserved area in front of an audience. The monarch was accompanied
by his men and controls were put in place to increase their safety and ease of
killing. The earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an ancient Egyptian
inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh Amenhotep III killing
102 lions in ten years "with his own arrows". The Assyrian emperor
Ashurbanipal had one of his lion hunts depicted on a sequence of Assyrian
palace reliefs c. 640 BC, known as the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal. Lions were
also hunted during the Mughal Empire, where Emperor Jahangir is said to have
excelled at it.[236] In Ancient Rome, lions were kept by emperors for hunts,
gladiator fights and executions.[237]

The Maasai people have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of
passage. Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to
reduced lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts.[238] During the
European colonisation of Africa in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was
encouraged because they were considered pests and lion skins were sold for £1
each.[239] The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions
would dominate a large part of the century.[240] Trophy hunting of lions in
recent years has been met with controversy, notably with the killing of Cecil
the lion in mid-2015.[241]

### Man-eating

Further information: Man-eater lions

Lions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them
out. One well-publicised case is the Tsavo maneaters; in 1898, 28 officially
recorded workers building the Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine
months during the construction of a bridge in Kenya.[242] The hunter who
killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour; they
were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth
decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all
researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum
collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey
depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on
humans.[243] Sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the
behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.[244]

Lions' proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American
and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of
Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were
attacked and many eaten over this period. The incidents occurred near Selous
Game Reserve in Rufiji River and in Lindi Region near the Mozambican border.
While the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors
argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case,
conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which
lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been
documented.[245] Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern
Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon,
when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time
attacks on people.[246]

According to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger
National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions. Frump
said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the
park and forced refugees to cross the park at night.[247]

### Cultural significance

Main article: Cultural depictions of lions

The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture.
It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national
flags, and in contemporary films and literature.[41] It is considered to be
the 'King of the Beasts'[248] and has symbolised power, royalty and
protection.[249] Several leaders have had "lion" in their name including
Sundiata Keita of the Mali Empire, who was called "Lion of Mali",[250] and
Richard the Lionheart of England.[251] The male's mane makes it a particularly
recognisable feature and thus has been represented more than the female.[252]
Nevertheless, the lioness has also had importance as a guardian.[249]

In sub-Saharan Africa, the lion has been a common character in stories,
proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts.[253] In the Swahili
language, the lion is known as _simba_ which also means "aggressive", "king"
and "strong".[54] In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated
with healing and provides the connection between seers and the supernatural.
In other East African traditions, the lion represents laziness.[254] In much
of African folklore, the lion is portrayed as having low intelligence and is
easily tricked.[250] In Nubia, the lion-god Apedemak was associated with the
flooding of the Nile. In Ancient Egypt, lions were linked both with the sun
and the waters of the Nile. Several gods were conceived as being part lion,
including the war deities Sekhmet and Maahes, and Tefnut, the goddess of
moisture.[255]

The lion was a prominent symbol in ancient Mesopotamia from Sumer up to
Assyrian and Babylonian times, where it was strongly associated with
kingship.[256] The big cat was a symbol and steed of fertility goddess
Inanna.[249] Lions decorate the Processional Way leading to the Ishtar Gate in
Babylon which was built by Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE. The Lion
of Babylon symbolised the power of the king and protection of the land against
enemies, but was also invoked for good luck.[257] The constellation Leo the
lion was first recognised by the Sumerians around 4,000 years ago and is the
fifth sign of the zodiac. In ancient Israel, a lion represented the tribe of
Judah.[258] Lions are frequently mentioned in the Bible, notably in the Book
of Daniel, in which the eponymous hero is forced to sleep in the lions'
den.[259]

Indo-Persian chroniclers regarded the lion as keeper of order in the realm of
animals. The Sanskrit word _mrigendra_ signifies a lion as king of
animals.[260] In India, the Lion Capital of Ashoka, erected by Emperor Ashoka
in the 3rd century BCE, depicts four lions standing back to back. In Hindu
mythology, the half-lion Narasimha, an avatar of the deity Vishnu, battles and
slays the evil ruler Hiranyakashipu. In Buddhist art, lions are associated
with both _arhats_ and bodhisattvas and may be ridden by the Manjushri. Though
they were never native to the country, lions have played important roles in
Chinese culture. Statues of the beast have guarded the entrances to the
imperial palace and many religious shrines. The lion dance has been performed
for over a thousand years.[261]

In ancient Greece, the lion is featured in several of Aesop's fables, notably
The Lion and the Mouse. In Greek mythology, the Nemean lion is slain by the
hero Heracles who then wears its skin. Lancelot and Gawain were also heroes
slaying lions in medieval Europe. Lions continue to appear in modern
literature such as the Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's 1900 _The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz_ , and in C. S. Lewis's _The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_.
For cinema, the lion was portrayed as the ruler of animals in the 1994 Disney
animated feature film _The Lion King_.[262]
