The **Danube** (/ˈdæn.juːb/ _DAN -yoob_; see also other names) is a river in
Europe, the second-longest after the Volga in Russia. It flows through Central
and Southeastern Europe, from the Black Forest of Germany south through the
Danube Delta in Romania into the Black Sea. A large and historically important
river, it was once a frontier of the Roman Empire. In the 21st century, it
connects ten European countries, running through their territories or marking
a border. Originating in Germany, the Danube flows southeast for 2,850 km
(1,770 mi), passing through or bordering Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia,
Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Ukraine. Among the many cities on the
river are four national capitals: Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest, and Belgrade.
Its drainage basin amounts to 817,000 km2 (315,000 sq mi) and extends into
nine more countries.

The Danube's longest headstream, the Breg, rises in Furtwangen im Schwarzwald,
while the river carries its name from its source confluence in the palace park
in Donaueschingen onwards. Since ancient times, the Danube has been a
traditional trade route in Europe. Today, 2,415 km (1,501 mi) of its total
length are navigable. The Danube is linked to the North Sea via the
Rhine–Main–Danube Canal, connecting the Danube at Kelheim with the Main at
Bamberg. The river is also an important source of hydropower and drinking
water.

The Danube river basin is home to such fish species as pike, zander, huchen,
Wels catfish, burbot and tench. It is also home to numerous diverse carp and
sturgeon, as well as salmon and trout. A few species of euryhaline fish, such
as European seabass, mullet, and eel, inhabit the Danube Delta and the lower
portion of the river.

## Names and etymology

Today the river carries its name from its source confluence in Donaueschingen,
Germany, to its discharge into the Black Sea via the Danube Delta in Romania
and Ukraine.

The river was known to the ancient Greeks as the _Istros_ (Ἴστρος)[9] from a
root possibly also encountered in the ancient name of the Dniester (_Danaster_
in Latin, _Tiras_ in Greek) and akin to Iranic _turos_ 'swift' and Sanskrit
_iṣiras_ (इषिरस्) 'swift', from the PIE *_isro-_ , *_sreu_ 'to flow'.[10]

In the Middle Ages, the Greek _Tiras_ was borrowed into Italian as _Tyrlo_ and
into Turkic languages as _Tyrla_ ; the latter was further borrowed into
Romanian as a regionalism (_Turlă_).[10]

The Thraco-Phrygian name was _Matoas_ ,[11] "the bringer of luck".[12]

The Middle Mongolian name for the Danube was transliterated as _Tho-na_ in
1829 by Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat.[13]

The modern languages spoken in the Danube basin all use names derived from the
Latin name _Danubius_ :

### Etymology

_Danube_ is an Old European river name derived from the Celtic 'Danu' or
'Don'[16] (both Celtic gods), which itself derived from the Proto-Indo-
European *_deh₂nu_. Other European river names from the same root include the
Dunaj, Dzvina/Daugava, Don, Donets, Dnieper, Dniestr, Dysna and Tana/Deatnu.
In Rigvedic Sanskrit, _danu_ (दनु) means "fluid, dewdrop" and _danuja (दनु-ज)_
means "born from _danu_ " or "born from dew-drops". In Avestan, the same word
means "river". The Finnish word for Danube is _Tonava_ , which is most likely
derived from the name of the river in German, _Donau_. Its Sámi name _Deatnu_
means "Great River". It is possible that _dānu_ in Scythian as in Avestan was
a generic word for "river": _Dnieper_ and _Dniestr_ , from _Danapris_ and
_Danastius_ , are presumed to continue Scythian *_dānu apara_ "far river" and
*_dānu nazdya-_ "near river", respectively.[17]

In Latin, the Danube was variously known as _Danubius_ , _Danuvius_ ,
_Ister_[18] or _Hister_. The Latin name is masculine, as are all its Slavic
names, except Slovene (the name of the Rhine is also masculine in Latin, most
of the Slavic languages, as well as in German). The German _Donau_ (Early
Modern German _Donaw_ , _Tonaw_ ,[19] Middle High German _Tuonowe_)[20] is
feminine, as it has been re-interpreted as containing the suffix _-ouwe_
"wetland".

Romanian differs from other surrounding languages in designating the river
with a feminine term, _Dunărea_ (IPA: [ˈdunəre̯a]).[10] This form was not
inherited from Latin, although Romanian is a Romance language.[14] To explain
the loss of the Latin name, scholars who suppose that Romanian developed near
the large river propose[14] that the Romanian name descends from a
hypothetical Thracian *_Donaris_. The Proto-Indo-European root of this
presumed name is related to the Iranic word "_don-_ "/"_dan-_ ", while the
supposed suffix _-aris_ is encountered in the ancient name of the Ialomița
River, _Naparis_ , and in the unidentified _Miliare_ river mentioned by
Jordanes in his Getica.[10] Gábor Vékony says that this hypothesis is not
plausible, because the Greeks borrowed the _Istros_ form from the native
Thracians.[14] He proposes that the Romanian name is a loanword from a Turkic
language (Cuman or Pecheneg).[14]

into the Brigach.

Classified as an international waterway, it originates in the town of
Donaueschingen, in the Black Forest of Germany, at the confluence of the
rivers Brigach and Breg. The Danube then flows southeast for about 2,730 km
(1,700 mi), passing through four capital cities (Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest,
and Belgrade) before emptying into the Black Sea via the Danube Delta in
Romania and Ukraine.

### International status

Once a long-standing frontier of the Roman Empire, the river passes through or
touches the borders of 10 countries. Its drainage basin extends into nine more
(ten if Kosovo is included).[21]

### Drainage basin

In addition to the bordering countries (see above), the drainage basin
includes parts of nine more countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina (4.6% of the
basin area), the Czech Republic (2.9%), Slovenia (2.0%), Montenegro (0.9%),
Switzerland (0.2%), Italy (<0.15%), Poland (<0.1%), North Macedonia (<0.1%)
and Albania (<0.1%).[21] The total drainage basin is 801,463 km2 (309,447 sq
mi) in area,[22][23] and is home to 83 million people.[24] The highest point
of the drainage basin is the summit of _Piz Bernina_ at the Italy–Switzerland
border, at 4,049 m (13,284 ft).[25] The Danube river basin is divided into
three main parts, separated by "gates" where the river is forced to cut
through mountainous sections:[24]

  * **Upper Basin** , from the headwaters to the Devín Gate.
  * **Middle Basin** , usually called the Pannonian basin or Carpathian Basin, between the Devín Gate and the Iron Gates. It includes the Hungarian plains Kisalföld and Alföld.
  * **Lower Basin** , from the Iron Gates to the river mouth, including the Danube Delta.

## Sectioning

  * Upper Section: From spring to Devín Gate, at the border of Austria and Slovakia. Danube remains a characteristic mountain river until Passau, with average bottom gradient 0.12% (1200 ppm), from Passau to Devín Gate the gradient lessens to 0.06% (600 ppm).
  * Middle Section: From Devín Gate to Iron Gate, at the border of Serbia and Romania. The riverbed widens and the average bottom gradient becomes only 0.006% (60 ppm).
  * Lower Section: From Iron Gate to Pătlăgeanca, with average gradient as little as 0.003% (30 ppm).
  * Delta: From Pătlăgeanca to Sulina, where the Danube meets the Black Sea. The river splits into three main distributaries.[35]

The Danube is navigable by ocean ships from the Black Sea to Brăila in Romania
(the maritime river sector), and further on by river ships to Kelheim,
Bavaria, Germany; smaller craft can navigate further upstream to Ulm,
Württemberg, Germany. About 60 of its tributaries are also navigable.

Since the completion of the German Rhine–Main–Danube Canal in 1992, the river
has been part of a trans-European waterway from Rotterdam on the North Sea to
Sulina on the Black Sea, a distance of 3,500 km (2,200 mi). In 1994 the Danube
was declared one of ten Pan-European transport corridors, routes in Central
and Eastern Europe that required major investment over the following ten to
fifteen years.[_citation needed_] The amount of goods transported on the
Danube increased to about 100 million tons in 1987. In 1999, transport on the
river was made difficult by the NATO bombing of three bridges in Serbia during
the Kosovo War. Clearance of the resulting debris was completed in 2002, and a
temporary pontoon bridge that hampered navigation was removed in
2005.[_citation needed_]

At the Iron Gate, the Danube flows through a gorge that forms part of the
boundary between Serbia and Romania; it contains the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric
Power Station dam, followed at about 60 km (37 mi) downstream (outside the
gorge) by the Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station. On 13 April 2006, a
record peak discharge at Iron Gate Dam reached 15,400 m3/s (540,000 cu ft/s).

There are three artificial waterways built on the Danube: the Danube-Tisa-
Danube Canal (DTD) in the Banat and Bačka regions (Vojvodina, northern
province of Serbia); the 64 km (40 mi) Danube-Black Sea Canal, between
Cernavodă and Constanța (Romania) finished in 1984, shortens the distance to
the Black Sea by 400 km (250 mi); the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal is about 171 km
(106 mi), finished in 1992, linking the North Sea to the Black Sea.[36] A
Danube-Aegean canal has been proposed.[37]

Cruising on the Danube is a popular sightseeing activity, especially between
Passau, Germany, to Budapest, Hungary.[38]

## Piracy

In 2010–12, shipping companies, especially from Ukraine, claimed that their
vessels suffered from "regular pirate attacks" on the Serbian and the Romanian
stretches of the Danube.[39][40][41] However, the transgressions may not be
considered acts of piracy, as defined according to the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, but rather instances of "river robbery".[42]

On the other hand, media reports say the crews on transport ships often steal
and sell their own cargo and then blame the plundering on "pirates", and the
alleged attacks are not piracy but small-time contraband theft along the
river.[43]

## Danube Delta

Main article: Danube Delta

Russian-
speaking Lipovans in the Danube Delta

The Danube Delta (Romanian: _Delta Dunării_ pronounced [ˈdelta ˈdunərij];
Ukrainian: Дельта Дунаю, romanized:  _Del'ta Dunayu_) is the largest river
delta in the European Union. The greater part of the Danube Delta lies in
Romania (Tulcea county), while its northern part, on the left bank of the
Chilia arm, is situated in Ukraine (Odesa Oblast). The approximate surface is
4,152 km2 (1,603 sq mi), of which 3,446 km2 (1,331 sq mi) are in Romania. If
one includes the lagoons of Razim-Sinoe (1,015 km2 (392 sq mi) of which 865
km2 (334 sq mi) water surface), which are located south of the delta proper,
but are related to it geologically and ecologically (their combined territory
is part of the World Heritage Site), the total area of the Danube Delta
reaches 5,165 km2 (1,994 sq mi).

The Danube Delta is also the best-preserved river delta in Europe, a UNESCO
World Heritage Site (since 1991) and a Ramsar Site. Its lakes and marshes
support 45 freshwater fish species. Its wetlands support vast flocks of
migratory birds of over 300 species, including the endangered pygmy cormorant
(_Phalacrocorax pygmaeus_). These are threatened by rival canalization and
drainage schemes such as the Bystroye Canal.[44]

## International cooperation

### Ecology and environment

Main article: International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Pelicani_din_Delta_Dunarii.PNG/250px-

The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) is
an organization that consists of 14 member states (Germany, Austria, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Montenegro, and Ukraine) and the European
Union. The commission, established in 1998, deals with the whole Danube river
basin, which includes tributaries and groundwater resources. Its goal is to
implement the Danube River Protection Convention by promoting and coordinating
sustainable and equitable water management, including conservation,
improvement, and rational use of waters and the implementation of the EU Water
Framework Directive and the Danube Strategy.

### Navigation

Main article: Danube Commission

The Danube Commission is concerned with the maintenance and improvement of the
river's navigation conditions. It was established in 1948 by seven countries
bordering the river. Members include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and
Serbia; it meets regularly twice a year. It also convenes groups of experts to
consider items provided for in the commission's working plans.

The commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856 and 1921, which
established for the first time an international regime to safeguard free
navigation on the Danube. Today the Commission include riparian and non-
riparian states.

Although the headwaters of the Danube are relatively small today,
geologically, the Danube is much older than the Rhine, with which its
catchment area competes in today's southern Germany. This has a few
interesting geological complications. Since the Rhine flows north towards the
North Sea, a continental divide beginning at Piz Lunghin divides large parts
of southern Germany, which is sometimes referred to as the European Watershed.

Before the last ice age in the Pleistocene, the Rhine started at the
southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that
today feed the Rhine were carried east by the so-called _Urdonau_ (original
Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's
Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of
the Swabian Alb. The erosion of the Upper Rhine valley led to stream capture;
waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine.
Today's upper Danube is thus an underfit stream.

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Danube_Iron_Gorge_La_Cazane.JPG/250px-
Danube_Iron_Gorge_La_Cazane.JPG)The Iron Gate, on the Serbian-Romanian border
(Iron Gates natural park and Đerdap national park)

Since the Swabian Alb is largely shaped of porous limestone, and since the
Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry
much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the
Danube carries little water, it completely sinks into these underground
channels at two locations in the Swabian Alb, which are referred to as the
Donauversickerung (Danube Sink). Most of this water resurfaces only 12 km (7.5
mi) south at the Aachtopf, Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an
average of 8,500 L/s (300 cu ft/s), north of Lake Constance—thus feeding the
Rhine. The European Water Divide applies only for those waters that pass
beyond this point, which only occurs during the days of the year when the
Danube carries enough water to survive the sinkholes in the Donauversickerung.

Since such large volumes of underground water erode much of the surrounding
limestone, it is predicted that the Danube upper course will one day disappear
entirely in favor of the Rhine, an event called stream capturing.

The hydrological parameters of Danube are regularly monitored in Croatia at
Batina, Dalj, Vukovar and Ilok.[45]

## History

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Guerre_d%27orient%2C_combat_sur_le_Danube.jpg/250px-
Guerre_d%27orient%2C_combat_sur_le_Danube.jpg)Combat between Russian and
Turkish forces on the Danube in 1854, during the Crimean War (1853–1856)

The Danube basin was the site of some of the earliest human cultures. The
Danubian Neolithic cultures include the Linear Pottery cultures of the mid-
Danube basin. Many sites of the sixth-to-third millennium BCE Vinča culture
(Vinča, Serbia), are sited along the Danube. The third millennium BCE Vučedol
culture (from the Vučedol site near Vukovar, Croatia) is famous for its
ceramics.

Darius the Great, king of Persia, crossed the river in the late 6th century
BCE to invade European Scythia and to subdue the Scythians.

Alexander the Great defeated the Triballian king Syrmus and the northern
barbarian Thracian and Illyrian tribes by advancing from Macedonia as far as
the Danube in 336 BCE.

Under the Romans, the Danube formed the border of the Empire with the tribes
to the north almost from its source to its mouth. At the same time, it was a
route for the transport of troops and the supply of settlements downstream.
From 37 CE to the reign of the Emperor Valentinian I (364–375) the Danubian
Limes was the northeastern border of the Empire, with occasional interruptions
such as the fall of the Danubian Limes in 259. The crossing of the Danube into
Dacia was achieved by the _Imperium Romanum_ , first in two battles in 102 and
then in 106 after the construction of a bridge in 101 near the garrison town
of Drobeta at the Iron Gate. This victory over Dacia under Decebalus enabled
the Province of Dacia to be created, but in 271 it was abandoned by emperor
Aurelian.

Avars used the river as their southeastern border in the 6th century.

### Ancient cultural perspectives of the lower Danube

Part of the rivers Danubius or Istros was also known as (together with the
Black Sea) the _Okeanos_ in ancient times, being called the _Okeanos Potamos_
(Okeanos River). The lower Danube was also called the _Keras Okeanoio_ (Gulf
or Horn of Okeanos) in the _Argonautica_ by Apollonius Rhodos (Argon. IV.
282).

At the end of the _Okeanos Potamos_ , is the holy island of Alba (Leuke, Pytho
Nisi, Isle of Snakes), sacred to the Pelasgian (and later, Greek) Apollo,
greeting the sun rising in the east. Hecateus Abderitas refers to Apollo's
island from the region of the Hyperboreans, in the Okeanos. It was on Leuke,
in one version of his legend, that the hero Achilles was buried (to this day,
one of the mouths of the Danube is called Chilia). Old Romanian folk songs
recount a white monastery on a white island with nine priests.[46]

Reprise_Buda_1686.jpg)The Holy League took Ottoman-held Buda after a long
siege in 1686.

Between the late 14th and late 19th centuries, the Ottoman Empire competed
first with the Kingdom of Serbia, Second Bulgarian Empire, Kingdom of Hungary,
Principality of Wallachia, Principality of Moldavia and later with the
Habsburg monarchy, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Russian Empire for
controlling the Danube (طونه, _Tuna_ in Turkish), which became the northern
border of the Ottoman Empire for centuries. Many of the Ottoman–Hungarian Wars
(1366–1526) and Ottoman–Habsburg wars (1526–1791) were fought along the river.

The most important wars of the Ottoman Empire along the Danube include the
Battle of Nicopolis (1396), the Siege of Belgrade (1456), the Battle of Mohács
(1526), the first Turkish Siege of Vienna (1529), the Siege of Esztergom
(1543), the Long War (1591–1606), the Battle of Vienna (1683), the Great
Turkish War (1683–1699), the Crimean War (1853–1856) and the Russo-Turkish War
(1877–1878).

In the 19th century the beaver was hunted to extinction along the Danube in
Bavaria.[47] The Beluga sturgeon population also collapsed, Danube sturgeons
had been commercially exploited for meat and caviar since the 5th century BC.
River regulation schemes commenced in the 19th century and continued into the
20th century. The Danube river has a total of 18 major dams, including Melk
and Freudenau in Vienna.[48]

### Second World War

During the 2011 renovation of the Margaret Bridge, Budapest, human remains
were discovered. The mostly Jewish remains were victims of the far-right Arrow
Cross Party, who briefly governed Hungary from 1944.[49]

## Economics

### Drinking water

Along its course, the Danube is a source of drinking water for about 20
million people.[50][51] In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, almost 30 percent (as
of 2004) of the water for the area between Stuttgart, Bad Mergentheim, Aalen
and Alb-Donau (district) comes from purified water of the Danube. Other cities
such as Ulm and Passau also use some water from the Danube.

In Austria and Hungary, most water is drawn from ground and spring sources,
and only in rare cases is water from the Danube used. Most states also find it
too difficult to clean the water because of extensive pollution; only parts of
Romania where the water is cleaner still obtain drinking water from the Danube
on a regular basis.[52]

### Navigation and transport

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Fischerzille_L%C3%BCA_10_m_Donau_bei_Greifenstein_Nieder%C3%B6sterreich.jpg/250px-
Fischerzille_L%C3%BCA_10_m_Donau_bei_Greifenstein_Nieder%C3%B6sterreich.jpg)Fishing
from a Zille on the Danube in Lower Austria, 1982

In the 19th century, the Danube was an important waterway but was, as _The
Times_ of London put it, "annually swept by ice that will lift a large ship
out of the water or cut her in two as if she were a carrot."[53]

Today, as "Corridor VII" of the European Union, the Danube is an important
transport route. Since the opening of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal, the river
connects the Port of Rotterdam and the industrial centers of Western Europe
with the Black Sea and, also, through the Danube – Black Sea Canal, with the
Port of Constanța.

The waterway is designed for large-scale inland vessels (110 × 11.45 m) but it
can carry much larger vessels on most of its course. The Danube has been
partly canalized in Germany (5 locks) and Austria (10 locks). Proposals to
build a number of new locks to improve navigation have not progressed, due in
part to environmental concerns.

Downstream from the Freudenau locks in Vienna, canalization of the Danube was
limited to the Gabčíkovo dam and locks near Bratislava and the two double Iron
Gate locks in the border stretch of the Danube between Serbia and Romania.
These locks have larger dimensions. Downstream of the Iron Gate, the river is
free flowing all the way to the Black Sea, a distance of more than 860
kilometres (530 mi).

The Danube connects with the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal at Kelheim, with the
Donaukanal in Vienna, and with the Danube–Black Sea Canal at Cernavodă.

Apart from a couple of secondary navigable branches, the only major navigable
rivers linked to the Danube are the Drava, Sava and Tisa. In Serbia, a canal
network also connects to the river; the network, known as the
Danube–Tisa–Danube Canals, links sections downstream.

In the Austrian and German sections of the Danube, a type of flat-bottomed
boat called a Zille was developed for use along the river. Zillen are still
used today for fishing, ferrying, and other transport of goods and people in
this area.

### Fishing

The importance of fishing on the Danube, which was critical in the Middle
Ages, has declined dramatically. Some fishermen are still active at certain
points on the river, and the Danube Delta still has an important industry.
However, some of the river's resources have been managed in an environmentally
unsustainable manner in the past, leading to damage by pollution, alterations
to the channel, and major infrastructure development, including large
hydropower dams.[54]

The sturgeon stocks associated with the Danube river basin have, over the
centuries, formed the basis of a large and significant commercial fishery,
renowned throughout the world. The construction of the dams, besides
overfishing and river pollution, has a significant role in sturgeon population
decline because it creates a barrier for fish migratory species that usually
spawn in the upper parts of the river.[55] The spawning areas of migratory
fishes species has been dramatically reduced by the construction of hydropower
and navigation systems at Iron Gates I (1974) and Iron Gates II (1984).[56]
The initial design of these dams has not included any fish passage
facility.[57] The possibility of building a human-made fish pass enabling
migration for fish species including the sturgeon, is currently under review
by projects such as We Pass.[58]

The Upper Danube ecoregion alone has about 60 fish species and the Lower
Danube–Dniester ecoregion has about twice as many.[59] Among these are an
exceptionally high diversity of sturgeon, a total of six species (beluga,
Russian sturgeon, bastard sturgeon, sterlet, starry sturgeon and European sea
sturgeon), but these are all threatened and have largely–or entirely in the
case of the European sea sturgeon–disappeared from the river.[59] The huchen,
one of the largest species of salmon, is endemic to the Danube basin, but has
been introduced elsewhere by humans.[60]

### Tourism

Important tourist and natural spots along the Danube include the Wachau
Valley, the Nationalpark Donau-Auen in Austria, Gemenc in Hungary, the
Naturpark Obere Donau in Germany, Kopački rit in Croatia, Iron Gate in Serbia
and Romania, the Danube Delta in Romania, and the Srebarna Nature Reserve in
Bulgaria.

Also, leisure and travel cruises on the river are of significance. Besides the
often frequented route between Vienna and Budapest, some ships even go from
Passau in Germany to the Danube Delta and back. During the peak season, more
than 70 cruise liners are in use on the river, while the traffic-free upper
parts can only be discovered with canoes or boats.

The Danube region is not only culturally and historically of importance, but
also important for the regional tourism industry due to its fascinating
landmarks and sights. With its well established infrastructure regarding
cycling, hiking, and travel possibilities, the region along the Danube
attracts every year an international clientele. In Austria alone, there are
more than 14 million overnight stays and about 6.5 million arrivals per
year.[61]

The Danube Banks in Budapest are a part of Unesco World Heritage sites, they
can be viewed from a number of sightseeing cruises offered in the city.

The Danube Bend is also a popular tourist destination.

The Danube Bike Trail (also called Danube Cycle Path or the _Donauradweg_) is
a bicycle trail along the river. Especially the parts through Germany and
Austria are very popular, which makes it one of the 10 most popular bike
trails in Germany.[62]

The Danube Bike Trail starts at the origin of the Danube and ends where the
river flows into the Black Sea. It is divided into four sections:

  1. Donaueschingen–Passau (559 km or 347 mi)
  2. Passau–Vienna (340 km or 210 mi)
  3. Vienna–Budapest (306 km or 190 mi)
  4. Budapest–Black Sea (1,670 km or 1,040 mi)

#### Sultans Trail

The Sultans Trail is a hiking trail that runs along the river between Vienna
and Smederevo in Serbia. From there the Sultans Trail leaves the Danube,
terminating in Istanbul. Sections along the river are as follows.

  1. Vienna–Budapest (323 km or 201 mi)
  2. Budapest–Smederevo (595 km or 370 mi)

#### Donausteig

The Route of Emperors and Kings is an international touristic route leading
from Regensburg to Budapest, calling in Passau, Linz and Vienna.[64] The
international consortium _ARGE Die Donau-Straße der Kaiser und Könige_ ,
comprising ten tourism organisations, shipping companies, and cities, strives
for the conservation and touristic development of the Danube region.[61]

In medieval Regensburg, with its maintained old town, stone bridge and
cathedral, the Route of Emperors and Kings begins. It continues to
Engelhartszell, with the only Trappist monastery in Austria. Further
highlight-stops along the Danube, include the "Schlögener Schlinge", the city
of Linz, which was European Capital of Culture in 2009 with its contemporary
art richness, the Melk Abbey, the university city of Krems and the
cosmopolitan city of Vienna. Before the Route of Emperors and Kings ends, you
pass Bratislava and Budapest, the latter of which was seen as the twin town of
Vienna during the times of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Since ancient Roman
times, famous emperors and their retinue traveled on and along the Danube and
used the river for travel and transportation. While traveling on the mainland
was quite exhausting, most people preferred to travel by ship on the Danube.
So the Route of Emperors and Kings was the setting for many important
historical events, which characterize the Danube up until today.

The route got its name from the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I of Barbarossa
and the crusaders as well as from Richard I of England who had been jailed in
the Dürnstein Castle, which is situated above the Danube. The most imperial
journeys throughout time were those of the Habsburg family. Once crowned in
Frankfurt, the emperors ruled from Vienna and also held in Regensburg the
Perpetual Diet of Regensburg. Many famous castles, palaces, residences, and
state-run convents were built by the Habsburger along the river. Nowadays they
still remind us of the bold architecture of the "Donaubarock".

Today, people can not only travel by boat on the Danube but also by train, by
bike on the Danube Bike Trail or walk on the "Donausteig" and visit the UNESCO
World Heritage cities of Regensburg, Wachau and Vienna.[65]

  * The Danube is mentioned in the title of a famous waltz by Austrian composer Johann Strauss, _The Blue Danube Waltz_ (_On the Beautiful Blue Danube_). This piece is well known across the world and is also used widely as a lullaby. _The Waves of the Danube_ (Romanian: _Valurile Dunării_) is a waltz by the Romanian composer Iosif Ivanovici (1845–1902); as the Anniversary Song, it has been performed by many vocalists, such as Al Jolson, Rosemary Clooney, Vera Lynn, Tom Jones, and countless others. It is most commonly known as the Anniversary Waltz, though that is actually a different song and melody. Joe Zawinul wrote a symphony about the Danube called _Stories of the Danube_. It was performed for the first time at the 1993 Bruckner festival, at Linz.
  * The Danube figures prominently in the Bulgarian National Anthem, as a symbolic representation of the country's natural beauty. In Lithuanian folklore songs, the appearance of Danube (Dunojus, Dunojėlis) is more common than the appearance of the longest Lithuanian river Neman.
  * The German and Austrian tradition of landscape painting, the Danube school, developed in the 16th century Danube valley by artists who worked autonomously.[66]
  * One of Claudio Magris's masterpieces is called _Danube_ (ISBN 1-86046-823-3). The book, published in 1986, is a large cultural-historical essay, in which Magris travels the Danube from the first sources to the delta, tracing the European ethnic and cultural heritage, literary and ideological history.
  * _The Great Danube Adventure_ was published in 1838 as epic travel diary.
  * Jules Verne's _The Danube Pilot_ (1908) (_Le Pilote du Danube_) depicts the adventures of fisherman Serge Ladko as he travels down the river.
