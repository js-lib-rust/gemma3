        Here are the types of heart, also known as cardiac, measurements:
        
        * **Systolic Pressure** is the top number in a blood pressure reading, representing the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pushes blood out; it is measured in mmHg
        * **Diastolic Pressure** is the lower number in a blood pressure reading, measuring the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests and refills with blood between beats; it is measured in mmHg
        * **Pulse Pressure (PP)** is the simple difference between your systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) blood pressure numbers, representing the force your heart generates with each beat; it is measured in mmHg
        * **Heart Rate**, also known as **Pulse**, is the number of times your heart beats per minute (bpm) and it reflects how hard your heart is working to pump blood; it is measured in bpm

      content: What is normal value for systolic blood pressure?
    - role: model
      content: A normal systolic blood pressure (the top number) for adults is less than 120 mmHg. Readings between 120-129 systolic are considered elevated, while 130 or higher starts to indicate high blood pressure (hypertension).

      content: What is normal value for diastolic blood pressure?
    - role: model
      content: A normal diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) for adults is less than 80 mmHg, with the ideal being below 80 mmHg. Readings of 80-89 mmHg indicate elevated or Stage 1 hypertension, requiring attention, while 90 mmHg or higher signifies Stage 2 hypertension.

      content: What is normal value for pulse pressure?
    - role: model
      content: Pulse pressure (PP) is typically around 40 mmHg in healthy adults. While a normal pulse pressure indicates healthy artery flexibility, a wide (high) or narrow (low) reading can signal underlying issues like stiff arteries or low blood volume.
